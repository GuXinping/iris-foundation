Some tokens at this address have been delegated to secure the network; Balance + Delegated makes the total of 15%.

**[Core Dev (Tendermint)](https://www.irisplorer.io/#/address/1/iaa13wqpy0ehazj7alvyc8ch36dsszp704pwts47wc)**:	10%, 200,000,000.  Reserved for the Tendermint team, with a two-year vesting period.

**[IRIS Foundation](https://www.irisplorer.io/#/address/1/iaa1p7qu0acxgwrg059va65cl8sq3w9japnkj93vrc)**:	15%, 300,000,000. 	Reserved to support operations of the Foundation, the current plan is to keep yearly spending below 30,000,000.  Furthermore, the Foundation is committed to locking this account for the first six months after the mainnet launch.   

**[Cosmos Hub Airdrop](https://www.irisplorer.io/#/address/1/iaa1y4ze04mauet065h2eehr5cwpskr7j6275j46ch)**:	5%, 100,000,000. 	Reserved for a special Cosmos Hub airdrop that will be used for staking purpose only.

**[Private Sale](https://www.irisplorer.io/#/address/1/iaa1n5x9ng3ufr29nw4eauzq6pkwzgkqrxdgacph4t)**: Initial value is 	500,000,000	which is 25%.  Private-sale pariticipants have different locking terms:
- 14% already been released 
- 1% locked for 4 months will be released on July 1st, 2019; 
- 6% locked for 6 months followed by 12-month linear release; 
- 4% locked for 9 months followed by 6-month linear release; 

The current balance of this account is smaller than the purported amount of locked tokens, the reason being that some of the locked tokens have been moved to (and locked at) special proxy accounts for staking purposes, which is arranged through the [VIL Program](vil_authorization_letter_template.md).
