Furthermore, this account will be locked for the first 6 months after the mainnet launch.   

**[Cosmos Hub Airdrop	for](https://www.irisplorer.io/#/address/1/iaa1y4ze04mauet065h2eehr5cwpskr7j6275j46ch)**	5%ï¼Œ100,000,000 	is reserved for a special Cosmos Hub airdrop which will be used for staking purpose only.

**[Private-sale](https://www.irisplorer.io/#/address/1/iaa1n5x9ng3ufr29nw4eauzq6pkwzgkqrxdgacph4t)**: Initial value is 	500,000,000	which is 25.000000%. Private-sale pariticipants have different locking terms: ~6% locked for 6 months followed by 12-month linear release; ~4% locked for 9 months followed by 6-month linear release; ~1% locked for 4 months; 10% locked for 2 months; <2% locked for 1 month; <2% without locking. 

The balance of this account is smaller than the total locked token numbers, the reason being that some of the locked tokens have been moved to (and locked at) special proxy accounts for staking purposes, which is arranged through the [VIL Program](vil_authorization_letter_template.md)
