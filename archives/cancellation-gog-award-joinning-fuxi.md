# Cancellation of IRISnet GOG: Registrants will be Awarded Double Points for Joining Fuxi Testnets

Dear Game of Genesis (GOG) Registrants,

Thanks for signing up for IRIS GOG which was intended to get potential validators ready for IRIS mainnet launch.

IRISnet is a BPoS blockchain, built with Cosmos-SDK, that enables cross-chain interoperability through a unified service model. IRISnet is going to be the first regional hub in Cosmos ecosystem and we are happy to see that many validators are validating both Cosmos and IRISnet. The original plan was for GOG to start after Cosmos Game of Stakes (GOS) to add value to the bigger Cosmos ecosystem. However, with the success of on-going GOS as well as its extended running time, looks like the necessity as well as feasibility of running GOG before middle of February (the planned IRIS Betanet launch time) is no longer there.  

Actually, as many GOG registrants are currently on GOS, we donâ€™t want to double the work for our validators. So, we would like to cancel GOG and invite registrants to focus on IRIS Fuxi tesnets. As gratitude, **GOG registrants earned tokens on Fuxi 8000 and Fuxi 9000 will be doubled**: Learn how to [join Fuxi-8000 here](https://www.irisnet.org/testnets). 

The reward tokens to validators can be used to join IRIS genesis: Read more about [IRISnet Betanet Plan](iris-betanet-plan.md).

Thanks a lot for your support!
