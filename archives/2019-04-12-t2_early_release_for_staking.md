_Dear T2 private sale participants with IRIS tokens going to be released on May 1st, if you plan to stake to the network, you can request IRIS Foundation to release your tokens now for you to manage the staking yourself. You can send following release request from your email address, which you used for receiving the sale letter, to : presale@irisnet.org also cc harriet@irisnet.org to authorize IRIS Foundation for the early release to stake._ 

_For those tokens are under [VIL program](vil_authorization_letter_template.md), and don't want to stake further, you can specify this portion to authorize Foundation to unbond. Please remember there will be 21 days before the tokens can complete unbonding and can be released to you._

Title: Request for Staking Token Early Release [201*-**-T2-your reference Number]

Dear IRIS Foundation,

My IRIS Token Private Sale reference number is [201*--T2-*], and I have a total of # IRIS tokens which are locked for 2 months starting from March 1st. 

I would like to stake  # IRIS tokens to network and would like to request an early release to my account address [iaa***] which I own and have private key to operate.

I confirm I will stake as soon as I receive the tokens. 

I understand this early release might be carried out in batches, and if I don’t delegate the released tokens as promised, those unreleased tokens might subject to extended locking time beyond May 1st. 

[Your name here]
