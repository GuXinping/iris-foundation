# Expectations for IRIS Betanet

_To better prepare the community for participating in IRIS Betanet, we would like to communicate the expectations for this network:_

+ The Betanet is a functioning network. It represents the initial stage of IRIS Mainnet launch and allows users to preview and get familiar with Mainnet functionalities.

+ The Betanet is experimental in nature and should NOT be used for important or high value transactions.

+ During this experimental phase, __transactions from the Betanet will irreversibly persist into the Mainnet.__

+ The Betanet will likely suffer from unscheduled downtimes and experience emergency hard forks.

+ A broader Mainnet launch will follow soon after the Betanet has sufficiently matured.

These actions align with the projectâ€™s efforts to make continual enhancements to the overall security and stability of IRISnet.

__A note on Security and Phishing:__

We advise all users to take necessary safety precautions before interacting with the Betanet.  Always think twice before entering private key information.  Any user (or software) that gains knowledge of private key information will have access to the tokens controlled by the corresponding public key hash.

__Always verify instructions via official IRISnet communication channels published at [www.irisnet.org](https://www.irisnet.org)__


Thank you,

The IRIS Foundation
