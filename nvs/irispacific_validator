Hello, 

I am the representative of Node Pacific. We are a professional team of nodes, with strong technical strength and node construction experience.

Such as that we participated in the EOS main network startup and annual security audit; we are the founding node of Lambda, and our technicians can provide stable technical support for the IrisNET main network.

In addition, we also have strong operational capabilities. We are good at community governance. We build core governance communities in various public chains, such as EOS, the world's largest Chinese language governance community, to help discarding millions of EOS, etc. .

We are so pleasured to participate in the IrisNET network. We are willing to provide technical support for IrisNET, maintain the stability of the main network, and  build a governance community to make more contributions to the ecology.


My node is up now: b0614e289a6a23504a5815862641f1b113e3abd6@20.43.80.3:26656
