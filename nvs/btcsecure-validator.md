My name is Konstantin. I am a co-founder and representative of the BTC.Secure validator team.

We operate as a validator in the test networks of Minter Network for the last 5 months and have significant experience in stress testing on the network based on Tendermint.

We have a highly available validator infrastructure in Minter Network and Cosmos Network only using dedicated servers in Europe (Germany, Finland).

We are in the top 4 in the volume of the investment pool in the Minter Network - https://minternetwork.com/pools

And we confidently enter the top 3 in terms of the quality of the infrastructure and the amount of validator stake in Minter Network - https://overview.minter.store/Mp2f4d5478540c2ecd03d8c584f59f1e552353af043d981f27f39ac9de6b0f2c78

Recently launched a validator in Cosmos Network - https://hubble.figment.network/chains/gaia-12001/validators/83D5C5F72169043F54F1CA7095E488BAF3E849EF

Our resources are still in Russian, but English-language resources will soon appear for Irisnet and Cosmos Network.

The blog in which we write about our infrastructure, branded BTC.Secure Coin and experience of stress tests in Minter Network - https://blog.btcsecure.io/ru/

We have one of the most active validator communities in Minter Network in Telegram.

In addition, we are focused on developing services for people in convenient use with PoS networks, primarily based on the core of Tendermint.

The infrastructure for the validator in Irisnet is ready for launch. We will be very grateful for the support in IRIS coins.
