I'm Andy. I've been involved in many POS model public chain validators, Cosmos. I've helped the company run validator nodes
forup to four months.In the chainx Creation Contest of Polkadot Ecology, the first three results have become one of the chainx 
creation nodes. I've also run the Polkadot test network, but they belong to the company. I have run a complete IRIS node, and 
I will be a validator, focusing all my energy on IRIS and contributing to the community.
