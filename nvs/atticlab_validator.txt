Hello,

We are Attic Lab and we would like to run a validator on the Iris network.

We have not joined the network on the genesis but we see great potential in it and want to use this opportunity.

We are an EOS top-21 BP (along with being BP’s on Telos, BOS and meet.one), validator on the IOS blockchain and a baker on Tezos (under name Everstake).

We are also running a node on the Cosmos mainnet but haven’t been approved as a validator yet.
