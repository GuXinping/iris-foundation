# IRISnet BSN Node Service Grants Parogram

BSN Global Portal has been launched to provide public chain node service. Now node services of IRISnet mainnet and testnet are both accessible on [global.bsnbase.com](http://global.bsnbase.com)*.  

Dedicated to constantly improve node services of IRISnet on BSN Global, which is inseparable from the contributions of developers, IRIS Foundation plans to launch a BSN Global IRISnet Node Service Grants Program, encouraging and supporting developers to develop applications, like DeFi apps, iService apps, staking tools, explorers, etc. via IRISnet node service and give feedback. 

Every 2 weeks, IRIS Foundation will select one developer from those who applied and send him/her this one-time grant.
